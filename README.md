10. Word Find A popular diversion in the United States, “word find” (or “word
search”) puzzles ask the player to find each of a given set of words in a square
table filled with single letters. A word can read horizontally (left or right),
vertically (up or down), or along a 45 degree diagonal (in any of the four
directions) formed by consecutively adjacent cells of the table; it may wrap
around the table’s boundaries, but it must read in the same direction with no
zigzagging. The same cell of the table may be used in different words, but, in a
given word, the same cell may be used no more than once. Write a computer
program for solving this puzzle.
